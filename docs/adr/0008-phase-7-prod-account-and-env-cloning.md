# ADR 0008: Phase 7 prod account, built-in blue/green, and one-command environment cloning

- Status: accepted (Q1 open; Q2 to Q15 take the recommended answers)
- Date: 2026-10-27
- Amended 2026-10-27 (user): P1 keeps the PLAN layout, one thin root per environment, instead of one shared
  root. The clone script copies a root; the parity guard keeps the copies identical (sections B and C).

## Context

### Goal

Phase 7 adds a second AWS account (`prod`) under AWS Organizations. Prod is bootstrapped from the same code as dev. It runs the same `modules/app-ecs` with its own values, state, secrets and roles. Prod receives the exact image digest that dev built and scanned, and it deploys with ECS built-in `BLUE_GREEN`: an ALB with two target groups, a bake time, and a rollback driven by a CloudWatch alarm. The user also asked for a way to clone an environment easily. Neither feature may weaken what is already in place: NFR-9 (no apply, destroy or secret commands by Claude), no account IDs in git, file-pinned OIDC trust, and harden-runner block mode on every job that holds credentials.

### Requirements

| ID | What Phase 7 must deliver | State found (branch `phase-7-prod-account` at `d39b84c`) |
|---|---|---|
| FR-6 | `envs/<env>` uses an S3 backend in its own account with `use_lockfile`. Values differ only through tfvars | `envs/dev` is a full root of 10 files. Its backend key `envs/dev/terraform.tfstate` and `env = "dev"` are hard-coded in two files. There is no `envs/prod` |
| FR-13 | Prod account in Organizations, bootstrapped with `accounts/prod.tfvars`. Same digest dev ECR to prod ECR. Trigger by dispatch or release tag. `prod` environment with a reviewer | Not started. Bootstrap `env` validation allows `dev` or `prod`. Deploy scripts are already parameterized by `ENV`, and their self-tests already cover `prod` (`tf-init`, `render-task-def`, `ecs-preflight`, `ecs-deregister-revisions`) |
| FR-15 | Dev `ROLLING` with circuit breaker. Prod `BLUE_GREEN` with ALB, two target groups, bake time and alarm rollback | Dev is `ROLLING` with circuit breaker and rollback. The module has one target group, and the listener's default action forwards to it |
| NFR-1 | Account-bearing values are secrets, repo level for PR plans and environment level for apply and deploy | Repo: `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID_DEV`, `AWS_PLAN_ROLE_ARN_DEV`, `ALB_INGRESS_CIDRS_DEV`. Env `dev`: `AWS_APPLY_ROLE_ARN`, `AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN`. Environment jobs also read the repo secret `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID_DEV` |
| NFR-2, NFR-4 | Explicit permissions. harden-runner first, block on credentialed jobs | `harden_runner_policy.py` accepts only `vars.AWS_REGION`, `secrets.AWS_ACCOUNT_ID_DEV` and `env.ENV` in credentialed endpoints |
| NFR-3 | New tools pinned by version and checksum | crane is new (P9) |
| NFR-5 | Lock files, Dependabot | Dependabot `directories` include `/infra/terraform/envs/*` |
| NFR-7 | Session cap, trail and alert per account | Bootstrap creates the trail, the rule and the SNS email per account |
| NFR-8 | Default tags | Same locals in bootstrap and the env root |
| NFR-9 | User runs apply, destroy, secrets and Organizations | Unchanged. The clone script never runs `terraform`, `aws` or `gh` |

### Findings from official docs

1. **Provider.** `hashicorp/aws` v6.70.0 (2026-10-21) is the latest release, and it is the version in the lock files. Its `aws_ecs_service` docs document the following:
   - `deployment_configuration.strategy`: `ROLLING`, `BLUE_GREEN`, `LINEAR`, `CANARY`.
   - `bake_time_in_minutes`: 0 to 1440, used with `BLUE_GREEN`, `LINEAR` and `CANARY`.
   - `lifecycle_hook` (`AWS_LAMBDA` or `PAUSE`).
   - `alarms { alarm_names, enable, rollback }`.
   - `load_balancer.advanced_configuration`, which is "Required when using `BLUE_GREEN`": `alternate_target_group_arn`, `production_listener_rule`, `role_arn` ("allows ECS to manage the target groups"), and an optional `test_listener_rule`.
   - `deployment_controller.type` (`ECS` default) and `sigint_rollback`, which needs `wait_for_steady_state = true`.
2. **ECS blue/green.**
   - The deployment controller must be `ECS`.
   - The traffic shift is "an immediate (all-at-once) shift".
   - Bake time is "the duration when both blue and green service revisions are running simultaneously after the production traffic has shifted". Blue/green "may double your resource usage during deployments".
   - The lifecycle stages are `RECONCILE_SERVICE`, `PRE_SCALE_UP`, `SCALE_UP`, `POST_SCALE_UP`, `TEST_TRAFFIC_SHIFT`, `POST_TEST_TRAFFIC_SHIFT`, `PRE_PRODUCTION_TRAFFIC_SHIFT`, `PRODUCTION_TRAFFIC_SHIFT`, `POST_PRODUCTION_TRAFFIC_SHIFT`, `BAKE_TIME` and `CLEAN_UP`.
   - An ALB setup needs two IP target groups and a production listener rule; a test rule is optional. ECS rewrites the rule weights during a deployment.
3. **Failure detection.** The current failure-detection page says the circuit breaker and CloudWatch alarms "only support rolling update deployment and blue/green deployment types", that "either can trigger deployment failure", and that "the rollback method requires a previous deployment in COMPLETED state". The older alarm page says alarms are for "the rolling update (`ECS`) deployment controller". `BLUE_GREEN` runs on that controller, so the two pages agree. The alarm page also says: "If an alarm is in the `ALARM` state at the beginning of a deployment, Amazon ECS will not monitor alarms for the duration of that deployment". It recommends `HTTPCode_ELB_5XX_Count`.
4. **Load balancer infrastructure role.**
   - Trust: `ecs.amazonaws.com`, `sts:AssumeRole`, with no condition in the AWS example.
   - The managed policy `AmazonECSInfrastructureRolePolicyForLoadBalancers` is at v6 (edited 2026-02-12). It allows ELB `Describe{Listeners,Rules,TargetGroups,TargetHealth}` on `*`, `Register/DeregisterTargets` on `targetgroup/*/*`, `ModifyListener` on `listener/app/*/*/*` and `listener/net/*/*/*`, and `ModifyRule` on `listener-rule/app/*/*/*/*`.
   - Whoever creates or updates the service needs `iam:PassRole` on it with `iam:PassedToService = ecs.amazonaws.com`.
5. **Service deployments API.**
   - `ServiceDeployment.status` values: `PENDING`, `SUCCESSFUL`, `STOPPED`, `STOP_REQUESTED`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `ROLLBACK_REQUESTED`, `ROLLBACK_IN_PROGRESS`, `ROLLBACK_SUCCESSFUL`, `ROLLBACK_FAILED`. It also carries `lifecycleStage`, `statusReason` and `targetServiceRevision`.
   - IAM (service reference): `ListServiceDeployments` on `service`. `DescribeServiceDeployments` on `service` and `service-deployment/${Cluster}/${Service}/${Id}`. `DescribeServiceRevisions` on `service` and `service-revision/${Cluster}/${Service}/${Id}`.
   - `UpdateService` keeps the `ecs:task-definition` condition key.
6. **CloudWatch.** `PutMetricAlarm`, `DeleteAlarms`, `DescribeAlarms` and `SetAlarmState` support the `alarm` resource type. The tag actions support `alarm` too.
7. **ECR.**
   - `GetAuthorizationToken` returns a token that "can be used to access any Amazon ECR registry that your IAM principal has access to".
   - A cross-account pull needs a repository policy in the source account that allows `ecr:BatchGetImage` and `ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer`. The puller also needs `GetAuthorizationToken` in its own IAM policy.
   - `crane copy` "copies a remote image from src to dst while retaining the digest value".
   - go-containerregistry v0.22.1 (2026-09-04) ships `checksums.txt` and an in-toto provenance file. GitHub reports these asset digests:
     - `go-containerregistry_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz` `sha256:0ab7a1d6932a213aed964ce97666c3077fe691c8606413674a8b3e0b9ec4cda0`;
     - `go-containerregistry_Darwin_arm64.tar.gz` `sha256:2231fc8df8806d20d680ff1225db44e095a55dd6ac1ae8eced4faf4b278b78fb`.
8. **GitHub.**
   - The OIDC `sub` is `repo:O/R:environment:<name>` when a job references an environment, and `...:pull_request` only without one.
   - Reusable workflows: "Jobs using the matrix strategy can call a reusable workflow". For `./.github/workflows/x.yml`, "the called workflow is from the same commit as the caller". To use environment secrets in a reusable workflow, "set `environment` on the job in the reusable workflow", and "the caller workflow must still pass the secret". Workflow-level `env` is not propagated.
   - Environment variables take precedence over repository variables. The secrets docs I opened do not state a precedence rule for secrets, so this ADR never reuses one secret name across levels.
   - Required reviewers: up to six; "prevent self-review" is optional. Environment secrets are withheld until approval and are available on public repos on the free plan.
9. **Terraform workspaces** "are not a suitable isolation mechanism" when each deployment has its own backend credentials.
10. **Organizations.**
    - `create-account` creates `OrganizationAccountAccessRole` in the new member account.
    - The root user email must be unique.
    - Member accounts are created in the root and can be moved to OUs.
11. **zizmor** has an `overprovisioned-secrets` audit ("excessive sharing of the `secrets` context") and a `secrets-inherit` audit.

### Repo facts that shape the design

- About 38 workflow lines are dev-specific: literal `environment: dev`, the `secrets.AWS_ACCOUNT_ID_DEV` hosts, the `terraform-envs-dev` groups and `options: [dev]`.
- The trigger allowlist (`workflow_triggers.py`) accepts only `pull_request`, `push` and `workflow_dispatch`, so a reusable workflow (`workflow_call`) needs a policy change.
- `render-task-def.sh` replaces only the image of the **latest ACTIVE revision**. A revision the user registers by hand would therefore carry over into the next deploy (relevant to the P16 demo).
- Two Phase 7 items were deferred: the YAML loader for the workflow self-tests (ADR 0007), and the composite action for the AWS preamble (ADR 0006).
- `harden_runner_policy.py` N1 Low ("refuse `secrets` expressions in audit jobs") is due "when the policy is next touched".

### Evaluation of the reference clone script (`create_environment.sh <name>`)

| Behavior of the reference | Effect in this repo |
|---|---|
| Must run from `scripts/`, with relative paths | Run from anywhere else, it fails or writes to the wrong place. Our scripts resolve `$ROOT` in `lib.sh` |
| `cp -r environments/dev/* environments/<name>/` | `*` skips dotfiles, so `.terraform.lock.hcl` is **not** copied. CI runs `init -lockfile=readonly`, so the new env fails (NFR-5). It does copy gitignored local files if present (`*.auto.tfvars` with the account ID, a local `terraform.tfstate`, `tfplan`), plus `tests/dev.tftest.hcl` whose dev asserts fail for the new env |
| `sed` on `default = "dev"` in `variables.tf` | Our root variables have no defaults; `env` lives in `terraform.tfvars`. The sed matches nothing and succeeds silently, so the clone keeps `env = "dev"` and would plan dev's names in the new account |
| `sed` on `key = "dev/terraform.tfstate"` in `terraform.tf` | Our key is `envs/dev/terraform.tfstate` in `backend.tf`. It matches nothing, so the clone **writes to dev's state key** (in the new account's bucket) |
| `sed -i` | GNU and BSD (macOS) syntax differ |
| No name validation | `Dev`, `a b` and `../x` reach paths and AWS names |
| Not atomic | A failure halfway leaves a partial directory, and the "exists" check then blocks a retry |
| Prints "terraform init" | Our init needs `-backend-config=bucket=...`, and only after the account is bootstrapped |
| Not covered | `vpc_cidr`, bootstrap `accounts/<env>.tfvars`, the GitHub environment and secrets, the workflow env lists, harden-runner hosts, the OIDC trust, the README (D16) |

Verdict: the idea (one command plus printed next steps) is right. The mechanism (copying a directory and blind `sed`) is wrong for this repo. Its worst failure is that it **succeeds silently** with dev's env name and state key.

## Decision

### A. Decisions

| # | Decision | Alternatives | Pro | Con |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | **One thin root per environment (PLAN layout).** `envs/dev/` and `envs/prod/` each hold `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `locals.tf`, `providers.tf`, `versions.tf`, `outputs.tf`, `backend.tf`, `.terraform.lock.hcl`, `README.md`, `tests/envs.tftest.hcl` and a committed `terraform.tfvars`. Every root calls `modules/app-ecs`. The parity guard (P3) allows only four differences: `terraform.tfvars`, the `key` line of `backend.tf`, `versions.tf` and `.terraform.lock.hcl` | (s) One shared root with `<env>.tfvars` per env. (w) Terraform workspaces | Matches PLAN 7.3 and FR-6 as written, and HashiCorp's guidance to keep environments with separate accounts and credentials in separate configurations. **Staged upgrades:** each env has its own lock file, so Dependabot opens the provider bump for dev first, and prod follows after dev is proven. No migration: `envs/dev/` and its state key stay as they are | About 150 lines are copied per env. They cannot drift, because the parity guard fails a PR on any other difference. (s) would remove the copies, but a provider or Terraform bump would reach prod in the same merge as dev. (w) was rejected per Finding 9 |
| P2 | **Clone tool `scripts/new-env.sh` with `make new-env`** (spec in C). It generates the root `envs/<env>/` from `envs/<from>/`, `bootstrap/accounts/<env>.tfvars.example` and the gitignored `accounts/<env>.tfvars` with placeholders. It rewrites only named keys, refuses clearly on any doubt, and prints the user-run steps. It never runs `terraform`, `aws`, `gh` or `git` writes | The reference script as is. Docs only, no script. A script that also edits workflows and runs `gh` | One command, deterministic, testable offline, atomic. The workflow wiring is left to a reviewed diff that the parity guard enforces | Wiring is still manual (about 15 lines per env, printed by the script) |
| P3 | **Environment parity guard** in repo-guard and `make lint` (`scripts/workflow_envs.py` on the shared YAML loader). The env set `E` is the directories under `envs/`. Each root must be byte-identical to `envs/dev/` except the four files P1 allows, and must have `env = "<name>"` and `key = "envs/<name>/terraform.tfstate"`, a unique `vpc_cidr`, an `accounts/<name>.tfvars.example`, and an entry in every workflow env list (D) | No guard | A half-cloned env fails `guard (no AWS)` with a message naming the missing piece | One more helper with fixtures |
| P4 | **Env name rule** `^[a-z][a-z0-9]{1,7}$` everywhere (`lib.sh valid_env`, bootstrap and module `env` validation). The script also refuses `local`, `bootstrap`, `modules`, `tests`, `shared`, `all`, `env` | Keep the `["dev","prod"]` allowlist in Terraform | A third env needs no Terraform edit. The 8-character cap keeps every AWS name in limits: the CloudTrail bucket `sis-<env>-cloudtrail-<acct>-<region>-an` is at most 63 characters, the ALB and target group names at most 32 | The allowlist added no security (an env still needs bootstrap, a trust and a GitHub environment) but was easy to read |
| P5 | **Secret names** (table in H). Environment jobs read **environment-level, env-agnostic** names: `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`, `AWS_APPLY_ROLE_ARN`, `AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN`, `ALB_INGRESS_CIDRS`, plus `PROMOTION_TARGET_ACCOUNT_ID` in `dev` only. PR plan jobs (no environment) read **repo-level, suffixed** names `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID_<ENV>`, `AWS_PLAN_ROLE_ARN_<ENV>` and `ALB_INGRESS_CIDRS_<ENV>`. No name exists at two levels | One suffixed repo set for everything (today's dev model) | A parametrized job never needs `secrets[...]` with a computed name. No dependence on secret precedence (Finding 8) | The account ID is stored twice per env (repo and environment). `check-aws-config.sh` already fails on a mismatch with the role ARN |
| P6 | **Workflow parametrization.** (1) Environment-gated jobs stay in **top-level files**, parametrized by a `workflow_dispatch` choice input `env`: `environment: ${{ inputs.env \|\| 'dev' }}`, concurrency `terraform-envs-<env>`, workflow `env.ENV` from the same expression, validated by a step. Push to `main` still applies **dev only**. (2) The PR plan (no environment) moves to **one reusable workflow** `reusable-terraform-plan.yml` (plan, plan-role guardrails, sticky comment), called **once per env** from `terraform-iac.yml` with explicit secret mapping, never `secrets: inherit`. (3) `app-deploy.yml` stays the dev build-and-deploy file. Prod gets `app-promote.yml` (P9, P10). (4) No composite action: harden-runner must be step 1 with a per-job allowlist, and only 3 short preamble steps remain. The ADR 0006 deferred item is closed | (c1) Everything reusable, including apply and deploy. (c3) A workflow file per env. (c4) A matrix with `secrets[format(...)]` | The trust pin (`job_workflow_ref`) stays on the **top-level file** that holds the credentialed job, which is the strongest pin. The dev-only literals collapse to one choice list per file. Adding an env costs one 10-line caller job and three choice entries | Two patterns (top-level for env jobs, reusable for PR plan). (c1) would move the pin to the callee, which any merged caller on `main` can invoke, and environment secrets in callees still need passing (Finding 8). (c4) is flagged by zizmor's `overprovisioned-secrets` and by our endpoint policy |
| P7 | **OIDC trust shape unchanged.** `aud`, `sub`, `repository_id`, `repository_owner_id`, `ref = refs/heads/main` (apply, deploy) or `refs/pull/*/merge` (plan), `aws:RequestedRegion`, and `job_workflow_ref` on apply and deploy. The `workflow_files` local derives the deploy file: `app-deploy.yml` when `promotion_source_account_id` is null (dev, the build env), `app-promote.yml` otherwise (prod). Apply stays `terraform-iac.yml` plus `terraform-destroy.yml`. The plan role never pins a workflow, so the reusable plan needs no trust change | Pin the reusable callee. A tag `ref` for prod | No new trust concept. Dev trust does not change, so PR A needs **no bootstrap re-apply** | A third promoted env reuses `app-promote.yml` (intended) |
| P8 | **Policy updates (repo-guard).** Trigger allowlist: `workflow_call` only in `reusable-*.yml`, and such files carry nothing else. harden-runner policy: (1) a job with `uses:` (a reusable call) has no steps, so it is checked through its callee, and must not use `secrets: inherit`. (2) Credentialed endpoints may use only `vars.AWS_REGION`, `env.ENV` and `secrets.AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`. `secrets.AWS_ACCOUNT_ID_DEV` is allowed **only** in `app-promote.yml` job `promote`, for the source registry host. (3) The N1 Low item: audit jobs may not reference `secrets` in any form in endpoints (`secrets.`, `secrets[`, `toJSON(secrets)`), nor an `env` value built from a secret. (4) The workflow self-tests move from `sed` ranges to the YAML loader (ADR 0007 deferred) | Leave the policies as they are | Reusable workflows cannot widen triggers. One account expression per env job. Closes two carried items | More rules and fixtures |
| P9 | **Promotion = `crane copy` by digest, dev ECR to prod ECR, in the approved prod job.** The dev repository gets a **pull-only** repository policy: Principal is the prod account root, with Condition `StringEquals aws:PrincipalArn = arn:aws:iam::<prod>:role/sis-prod-gha-deploy` and actions `ecr:BatchGetImage` and `ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer`. The prod deploy role gets a matching identity statement on the one dev repository ARN. crane v0.22.1 is installed by `install-ci-tools.sh` (checksum-verified, `mise.toml` pin), with `DOCKER_CONFIG` in `$RUNNER_TEMP` (deleted after). No Docker is needed, so the job keeps `disable-sudo-and-containers: true` | (r) ECR cross-account replication. (d) `docker pull` and `push`. (l) An AWS CLI layer-by-layer copy. (x) Prod tasks pull straight from dev ECR. (art) Pass the image as an artifact from a dev-role job | Digest preserved by design (Finding 7). Prod never depends on dev at run time. Least privilege: one repo, two read actions, one principal | (r) replicates **every** dev push and keeps the source **repository name** (`sis-dev-app` would appear in prod, off the name contract and the boundary, and outside Terraform). (d) Docker recompresses layers, so the digest can change. (l) is about 100 lines of blob handling. (x) breaks when dev is torn down. (art) needs dev-role trust for a prod workflow and a public 1-day artifact. Cost of P9: the dev apply role gains `SetRepositoryPolicy` (R21), and a new tool to pin |
| P10 | **Prod release trigger = `workflow_dispatch` on `main`** with input `sha` (40 hex). A credential-free `resolve` job checks that the SHA is an ancestor of `origin/main` and that an `app-deploy` run for that SHA on `main` **succeeded** (`gh run list --workflow app-deploy.yml --commit <sha> --branch main`, `actions: read`). Only then does `promote` start | Tag `v*` (`on.push.tags`) | Keeps `ref = refs/heads/main` (`StringEquals`) on the prod trust, with no tag ruleset needed. "Promote what was green in dev" becomes a check, not a habit | No release object. Tags stay an optional later step (needs `StringLike ref` and a tag ruleset) |
| P11 | **Prod `BLUE_GREEN` in `modules/app-ecs`** behind `deployment_strategy` (`ROLLING` default, or `BLUE_GREEN`), detailed in E. Dev stays `ROLLING` with an unchanged resource shape | A separate prod module | One module, FR-6 | Conditional (`count` and `dynamic`) code paths, each covered by a test |
| P12 | **ECS load balancer infrastructure role** `sis-<env>-ecs-elb`, created by **bootstrap** (admin). Its inline policy is the managed policy's action set scoped to `sis-<env>-*`: ELB Describe on `*` (no resource-level support), `Register/DeregisterTargets` on `targetgroup/sis-<env>-*/*`, `ModifyListener` on `listener/app/sis-<env>-*/*/*`, `ModifyRule` on `listener-rule/app/sis-<env>-*/*/*/*`. Trust exactly as AWS documents it. Guardrail G4 protects it | Attach the AWS managed policy. Have the module (apply role) create the role | The apply role never creates a role with ELB write rights. The policy reaches only this env's ALB, while the managed policy covers every ALB and NLB in the account | AWS has edited the managed policy 6 times. A future ECS need fails closed (R20). The fallback is to attach the managed policy |
| P13 | **Uniform bootstrap** in every account: the infra role, the apply alarm statements, `PassRole` on the infra role, and the deploy service-deployment reads. Only the cross-account ECR read and the deploy workflow file depend on `promotion_source_account_id` | Prod-only statements by env name | One code path, so dev could switch strategy with a tfvars change | Dev holds unused grants scoped to `sis-dev-*` |
| P14 | **One rollout waiter for both strategies** on the service deployments API: `list-service-deployments`, then `describe-service-deployments`, then `describe-service-revisions` to match the target task definition. `SUCCESSFUL` passes. `ROLLBACK_*` and `STOPPED` fail with `statusReason`. The log prints `lifecycleStage`. The timeout covers the bake time | Keep `describe-services` for dev and add a second evaluator for prod | One evaluator, and the documented view of blue/green stages | A proven dev path changes. Dev needs the bootstrap re-apply first (B6) |
| P15 | **Two deploy guards.** (1) Preflight refuses while any `sis-<env>-*` alarm is in `ALARM` (Finding 3: ECS would ignore alarms for that deployment), using `cloudwatch:DescribeAlarms` on `alarm:sis-<env>-*`. (2) `render-task-def.sh` refuses a source revision whose container `environment` is not exactly `[{APP_ENV: <env>}]` | None | An alarm can never be silently ignored. A hand-made demo revision (P16) can never be promoted by accident | One read permission and one render rule |
| P16 | **Rollback demos.** Required: the user, with prod admin SSO, registers a revision with `BREAK=true` (same digest) and runs `update-service`. Green targets fail `/health`, the unhealthy-host alarm (or the circuit breaker) fails the deployment, and ECS rolls back while blue keeps serving. Then the revision is deregistered. Optional: during `BAKE_TIME` of a good promote, `set-alarm-state ALARM` shows traffic return to blue | A broken image through the pipeline (needs a broken commit on `main` or a promote input that accepts non-main tags) | No weakening of "only green `main` commits reach prod". No app change | "Broken" is a revision setting, not a different image. The P15 render rule keeps it from leaking |
| P17 | **Negative test N10** (PLAN 7.5): `app-promote.yml` dispatch input `mode: prove-isolation` runs job `isolation` with `environment: dev`. It runs `assert-web-identity-denied.sh plan apply deploy` with `ACCOUNT = secrets.AWS_ACCOUNT_ID_PROD` and `ENV=prod`. Its token carries `job_workflow_ref = app-promote.yml@refs/heads/main`, which the prod deploy role trusts, so **only `sub` differs** for that role | A step in the dev deploy job (its file is not in the prod trust, so two claims would differ). A no-environment job (tests the wrong claim) | Proves exactly "a dev-environment job is refused by prod". The prod alert email fires (a demo of NFR-7) | Needs a dev approval and sends prod alert emails |
| P18 | **PR plans run for prod too** (read-only prod plan role, FR-3 parity) | Plan only inside the approved prod apply | Reviewers see prod impact before merge | ADR 0007 residual M1 now spans prod read-only metadata (R25) |
| P19 | **ECR stays in the env stack** | Move both ECR repositories to bootstrap (persistent) | No re-architecture of a proven stack | Promotion needs the dev stack up (R22). Recorded as the next improvement |
| P20 | **Organizations.** A management account with no workloads, prod as a member, and the IAM Identity Center organization instance with an `AdministratorAccess` permission set assigned to the user (CLI profile `sis-prod-admin`). Phase 7 adds no SCPs | Prod as a standalone account. A region-deny SCP now | Matches PLAN 7.1. Costs nothing | Depends on Q1 (where dev's Identity Center lives) |
| P21 | **Bake time 5 minutes, `desired_count = 1`** in prod | 10 minutes or more | One extra task for about 5 minutes per deploy | A shorter window to catch problems |
| P22 | **Two PRs** (I) | One PR. Three PRs (split B into code and live proof) | PR A is fully provable on dev with no admin step | PR B is large; the build agent may split B into B1 (bootstrap and module) and B2 (workflows) if review needs it |

### B. Environment layout (P1)

```
infra/terraform/
  bootstrap/                      per account, unchanged shape
    accounts/dev.tfvars.example   committed; <env>.tfvars gitignored (account IDs)
    accounts/prod.tfvars.example  new (PR B): adds promotion_source_account_id = "<DEV_ACCOUNT_ID>"
  modules/app-ecs/                + BLUE_GREEN path (PR B)
  envs/
    dev/                          unchanged location and state key
      main.tf variables.tf locals.tf providers.tf outputs.tf   identical in every env (P3)
      versions.tf .terraform.lock.hcl                          may differ during a staged upgrade
      backend.tf                  only the key line differs
      terraform.tfvars            committed, no account ID (FR-6)
      README.md                   identical; names the env through terraform.tfvars only
      tests/envs.tftest.hcl       generic: expected names built from var.env, so it is identical too
    prod/                         PR B, generated by make new-env
```

- `tests/dev.tftest.hcl` becomes the generic `tests/envs.tftest.hcl` in PR A: every expected name is built from
  `var.env` (`"sis-${var.env}-cluster"`), and strategy-specific asserts key on `var.deployment_strategy`.
- `.gitignore`, `tf-init.sh` (`infra/terraform/envs/${ENV}`), `tf-check.sh` (one pass per root) and Dependabot
  (`/infra/terraform/envs/*`) already fit this layout. Only `.terraform-*/` (per-account `TF_DATA_DIR` for
  bootstrap) is added to `.gitignore`.
- `terraform-iac` push paths: `infra/terraform/envs/dev/**` and `infra/terraform/modules/**`, as today. A change
  under `envs/prod/` never starts a dev apply.
- **Staged upgrade flow:** Dependabot opens one PR per root. Merge the dev one, apply, check, then merge the prod
  one. Between the two, the parity guard accepts the version difference in `versions.tf` and the lock file only.

### C. Clone script spec (`scripts/new-env.sh`)

**Usage**

```
scripts/new-env.sh <env> [--from <env>] [--cidr 10.N.0.0/16] [--strategy ROLLING|BLUE_GREEN] [--dry-run]
make new-env ENV=<env> [FROM=dev] [CIDR=...] [STRATEGY=...] [DRY_RUN=1]
```

Exit codes: 0 created (or dry run shown), 1 refused, 2 usage.

**Validation (before any write)**

1. `<env>` matches P4, is not reserved, and differs from `--from`.
2. The source root `envs/<from>/` and `bootstrap/accounts/<from>.tfvars.example` exist.
3. **None** of the targets exist: `envs/<env>/`, `accounts/<env>.tfvars.example`, `accounts/<env>.tfvars`. Otherwise the script refuses and lists them (no partial overwrite, no "merge").
4. The source tfvars holds no `aws_account_id` and no 12-digit run.
5. Each rewritten key matches `^<key>[[:space:]]*=` **exactly once** in the source. Otherwise: "source format changed: update new-env.sh".
6. CIDR: given, or the next free `10.N.0.0/16` (N = highest used second octet + 10, at most 250). It must be a `/16` inside `10.0.0.0/8`, and its second octet must be unused by every `envs/*/terraform.tfvars`.
7. `accounts/<env>.tfvars` is confirmed ignored with `git check-ignore -q` before it is written.

**Writes (a temp directory next to the target, then one `mv`; an `EXIT` trap removes temps)**

| File | Content |
|---|---|
| `envs/<env>/` | Copy of the **tracked** files of `envs/<from>/` only (`git ls-files`), so `.terraform/`, `*.auto.tfvars`, local state and plan files are never copied, and the lock file is. Then in `terraform.tfvars`: header replaced ("Generated by scripts/new-env.sh from `<from>`; review every value"), rewritten keys `env`, `vpc_cidr`, `deployment_strategy` (if `--strategy`) and `promotion_target_env = ""` (a new env is never a promotion source). In `backend.tf`: the `key` line becomes `envs/<env>/terraform.tfstate`. Every other file and line is byte-identical |
| `bootstrap/accounts/<env>.tfvars.example` | Copy of the source example. Header "Copy to `<env>.tfvars`". Placeholder `<FROM_ACCOUNT_ID>` becomes `<ENV_ACCOUNT_ID>` (uppercase via `tr`, bash 3.2) |
| `bootstrap/accounts/<env>.tfvars` (gitignored, mode 600) | Same placeholders, for the user to fill. The script never takes or prints an account ID |

**Prints** a "Next steps (you run these)" list:

1. Account and SSO profile `sis-<env>-admin`.
2. Fill `accounts/<env>.tfvars`.
3. Bootstrap first apply on local state with `TF_DATA_DIR=.terraform-<env>`, then migrate state (commands as in the PR B checkpoint, with `<env>` filled and `<ENV_ACCOUNT_ID>` left as a placeholder).
4. GitHub environment `<env>` and the secret commands from H.
5. The exact YAML snippet of the plan caller job, plus the three choice lists to edit.
6. `make check` (the parity guard names what is missing).
7. Open a PR.

The repo slug comes from `git remote get-url origin`, with a placeholder as fallback.

**Never:** runs `terraform`, `aws`, `gh`, `git add`, `commit` or `push`; calls the network; prints a 12-digit run.

**Self-test** (`scripts/selftest/new-env.sh`, run by `ci-selftest.sh`; a temp git repo with fixture files plus copies of `lib.sh` and the script):

| T | Case | Expect |
|---|---|---|
| T1 | `qa --from dev` | `envs/qa/` plus the 2 account files. `diff -r` with `envs/dev/` shows only the rewritten keys and the backend key; the lock file is present; no `.terraform/` or `*.auto.tfvars` even when the source has them; header present; account file ignored, mode 600 |
| T2 | Run again | Exit 1, the 3 paths listed, files unchanged (hash) |
| T3 | Names `Dev`, `a`, `toolongname`, `../x`, `dev prod`, `bootstrap`, `local`, `''`, `qa\n../x` | Exit 1 or 2, nothing written |
| T4 | `--from` missing, or `--from qa` (self) | Refused |
| T5 | Auto CIDR with dev at 10.40 | 10.50.0.0/16. With a 10.50 env present: 10.60 |
| T6 | `--cidr` overlapping, `/24`, `192.168.0.0/16`, garbage | Refused |
| T7 | Source with `env` twice, or no `vpc_cidr` | "source format changed" |
| T8 | Source holding `aws_account_id` or a 12-digit run | Refused |
| T9 | `--dry-run` | Prints the plan, writes nothing (tree hash equal) |
| T10 | PATH stubs `terraform`, `aws`, `gh` that fail when called | Never called |
| T11 | Run from `/` | Works (no cwd dependence) |
| T12 | Target directory read-only mid-run | Exit 1, no target or temp file left |
| T13 | Output scan | No 12-digit run; contains the YAML snippet and `<ENV_ACCOUNT_ID>` |
| T14 | `.gitignore` regression: account file not ignored | Refused before writing |

Parity guard fixtures: a missing choice, an extra choice, a missing caller job, a mismatched `env =` line, a duplicate CIDR, a missing `.example`. Each must fail with a named message.

### D. Workflows

| File | PR A | PR B |
|---|---|---|
| `terraform-iac.yml` | `checks` unchanged. `plan-dev` calls `reusable-terraform-plan.yml` with `env: dev` and secrets `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID: secrets.AWS_ACCOUNT_ID_DEV`, `AWS_PLAN_ROLE_ARN: ...PLAN_ROLE_ARN_DEV`, `ALB_INGRESS_CIDRS: ...ALB_INGRESS_CIDRS_DEV`. `apply` takes `environment`, concurrency and `ENV` from `inputs.env \|\| 'dev'`, a dispatch choice `[dev]`, and env secrets `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` and `ALB_INGRESS_CIDRS`. Plan and apply use `-var-file="${ENV}.tfvars"` | `plan-prod` caller. Choice `[dev, prod]`. `plan-dev` also passes `PROMOTION_TARGET_ACCOUNT_ID: secrets.AWS_ACCOUNT_ID_PROD`. `apply` passes `TF_VAR_promotion_target_account_id: secrets.PROMOTION_TARGET_ACCOUNT_ID`, masked. `monitoring.<region>.amazonaws.com:443` added to plan, apply and destroy lists |
| `reusable-terraform-plan.yml` (new) | `on: workflow_call` (input `env`; secrets `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` required, `AWS_PLAN_ROLE_ARN` required, `ALB_INGRESS_CIDRS` optional, `PROMOTION_TARGET_ACCOUNT_ID` optional). Jobs `plan`, `plan-role-guardrails`, `comment` move here unchanged except names. Block allowlists use `secrets.AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`. The comment job still checks out `base.sha` | Same file |
| `terraform-destroy.yml` | `environment: ${{ inputs.env }}`, concurrency `terraform-envs-${{ inputs.env }}`, `ENV` from the input (validated in `confirm`), env secrets | Options `[dev, prod]` |
| `app-deploy.yml` | Dev only. `secrets.AWS_ACCOUNT_ID_DEV` becomes env secret `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` | Waiter (P14) |
| `app-promote.yml` (new, PR B) | n/a | Dispatch inputs: `env` choice `[prod]`, `sha`, `mode` choice `[promote, prove-isolation]`. Jobs: `resolve` (audit, `contents: read`, `actions: read`, no AWS); `promote` (`environment: ${{ inputs.env }}`, block, sudo and containers disabled; hosts: `github.com`, `release-assets.githubusercontent.com`, `sts`, `api.ecr`, `${{ secrets.AWS_ACCOUNT_ID_DEV }}.dkr.ecr...`, `${{ secrets.AWS_ACCOUNT_ID }}.dkr.ecr...`, `prod-<region>-starport-layer-bucket.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com`, `ecs`, `secretsmanager`, `monitoring`); `isolation` (N10, `environment: dev`, hosts `github.com` and `sts`) |
| `oidc-smoke-test.yml` | Unchanged | N1 dispatch also checks the prod roles (`AWS_ACCOUNT_ID_PROD`) |
| `repo-guard.yml` | Parity guard step (P3) | n/a |

The `promote` steps:

1. Check config and mask both accounts.
2. Assume the prod deploy role.
3. Preflight (stack up, secret current, no alarm in `ALARM`).
4. Resolve the source digest with `crane digest <dev>/sis-dev-app:<sha>`.
5. If the prod tag `<sha>` exists, its digest must equal the source digest, else fail. If it does not exist, `crane copy <dev>@<digest> <prod>/sis-prod-app:<sha>` and re-read the digest, which must be equal.
6. Render with `--env prod`, register, update.
7. Wait (P14) and write the summary (no account ID).
8. Remove `DOCKER_CONFIG` and the temp files.

### E. Module `BLUE_GREEN` (PR B)

- **Variables** (module and root):
  - `deployment_strategy` (`ROLLING`\|`BLUE_GREEN`);
  - `bake_time_minutes` (0 to 60, default 5);
  - `promotion_target_env` (default `""`);
  - `promotion_target_account_id` (sensitive, default `""`; cross-variable validation: 12 digits if the env is set, else empty).
- **ALB:**
  - Target group `sis-<env>-tg` (name contract) plus `sis-<env>-tg-alt`.
  - `ROLLING` keeps today's listener default forward, so dev's resource shape is unchanged.
  - `BLUE_GREEN`: the listener default is `fixed-response 404`. `aws_lb_listener_rule.production` (priority 1, `path-pattern /*`, weighted forward 100/0) carries `lifecycle { ignore_changes = [action] }`, because ECS rewrites the weights.
  - No test listener rule and no lifecycle hooks (Q11).
- **Service:**
  - `deployment_configuration { strategy, bake_time_in_minutes (BLUE_GREEN only) }`.
  - `alarms { alarm_names = [3 alarms], enable = true, rollback = true }` (BLUE_GREEN only).
  - `load_balancer.advanced_configuration { alternate_target_group_arn, production_listener_rule, role_arn = "arn:<p>:iam::<acct>:role/sis-<env>-ecs-elb" }`, built from the name contract like `boundary_arn`.
  - Circuit breaker stays on. `deployment_maximum_percent = 200`, minimum 100. `ignore_changes = [task_definition]` stays.
  - If the first prod plan after a promote shows `load_balancer` drift (a target group swap), add it to `ignore_changes` (R18, step B15).
- **Alarms** (no actions; ECS polls them):
  - `sis-<env>-tg-unhealthy` and `sis-<env>-tg-alt-unhealthy`: `AWS/ApplicationELB` `UnHealthyHostCount`, Maximum, period 60, 1 of 1, `> 0`, dimensions `TargetGroup` and `LoadBalancer` (`arn_suffix`), `treat_missing_data = notBreaching`.
  - `sis-<env>-alb-5xx`: `HTTPCode_ELB_5XX_Count`, Sum, period 60, `>= 5`, notBreaching (the AWS-recommended metric).
- **ECR:** `aws_ecr_repository_policy` exists only when `promotion_target_env != ""`. Pull-only, as in P9.
- **Tests:**
  - ROLLING produces no alt target group, rule, alarms or advanced configuration.
  - BLUE_GREEN produces all of them, with the role ARN built from the contract.
  - The repo policy has exactly two actions, the root principal and the `aws:PrincipalArn` condition. Its count is 0 when unset.
  - Validation rejects an env set without an account.
  - Each env root plans its own names.

### F. Bootstrap changes (PR B)

- `variables.tf`:
  - `env` regex (P4) is already in PR A;
  - new `promotion_source_account_id` (default null, 12 digits) and `promotion_source_env` (default `"dev"`).
- `locals.tf`: `workflow_files.deploy` as in P7. `resource_names` gains `target_group_alt`, `ecs_elb_role` and `alarm_prefix = "sis-<env>-"`.
- `iam_ecs_elb.tf` (new): the role and inline policy (P12).
- `iam_apply.tf`:
  - `CloudWatchAlarms`: `PutMetricAlarm`, `DeleteAlarms`, `DescribeAlarms`, `TagResource`, `UntagResource`, `ListTagsForResource` on `arn:<p>:cloudwatch:<region>:<acct>:alarm:sis-<env>-*`.
  - `PassEcsElbRole`: `iam:PassRole` on `role/sis-<env>-ecs-elb` with `iam:PassedToService = ecs.amazonaws.com`.
  - `EcrRepositoryPolicy`: `ecr:SetRepositoryPolicy` and `ecr:DeleteRepositoryPolicy` on `ecr_repo_pattern`.
- `iam_deploy.tf`:
  - `ServiceDeploymentsRead`: `ecs:ListServiceDeployments` on the service ARN; `ecs:DescribeServiceDeployments` on the service ARN and `service-deployment/sis-<env>-cluster/sis-<env>-app/*`; `ecs:DescribeServiceRevisions` on the service ARN and `service-revision/sis-<env>-cluster/sis-<env>-app/*`.
  - `AlarmsRead`: `cloudwatch:DescribeAlarms` on `alarm:sis-<env>-*`.
  - `EcrPullFromSource` (count when the source is set): `ecr:BatchGetImage` and `ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer` on `arn:<p>:ecr:<region>:<source>:repository/sis-<source_env>-app`.
- `iam_guardrails.tf`: G4 resources add `role/sis-<env>-ecs-elb`.
- `outputs.tf`: `ecs_elb_role_name`, with no ARN.
- Tests: `trust.tftest.hcl` covers the deploy file per source variable. `iam.tftest.hcl` covers the new statements, the no-wildcard-action rule and the PassRole condition.

### G. Least privilege

| Role | Trust (all: `aud = sts.amazonaws.com`, `repository_id`, `repository_owner_id`, `aws:RequestedRegion`) | Phase 7 change | `*` and justification |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sis-<env>-gha-plan` | `sub = <P>:pull_request`, `StringLike ref = refs/pull/*/merge` | New in prod (same code) | Unchanged (B20) |
| `sis-<env>-gha-apply` | `sub = <P>:environment:<env>`, `ref = refs/heads/main`, `job_workflow_ref` in [`terraform-iac.yml`, `terraform-destroy.yml`] @ main | + alarms on `sis-<env>-*`, + PassRole on the infra role, + repo policy on `sis-<env>-*` | Name-prefix wildcards only. **PassRole:** the one infra role, `PassedToService = ecs.amazonaws.com`. The role can only touch this env's ALB, which the apply role can already modify itself, so no escalation |
| `sis-<env>-gha-deploy` | Same shape. `job_workflow_ref` = `app-deploy.yml` (dev) or `app-promote.yml` (prod) | + service-deployment reads, + alarm read, + (prod) source pull | `service-deployment/.../*` and `service-revision/.../*` (random IDs, one service). **No new PassRole.** If ECS demands PassRole on the infra role at `UpdateService` (not documented), it fails closed (R31) |
| `sis-<env>-ecs-elb` (new) | `ecs.amazonaws.com` | Scoped copy of the managed policy | ELB `Describe*` on `*` (no resource-level support). No confused deputy: only principals with PassRole in this account can attach it |
| Exec and task roles | Unchanged | none | none |

New secrets: `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` (env `dev` in PR A; env `prod` in PR B), `ALB_INGRESS_CIDRS` (env, optional), `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID_PROD`, `AWS_PLAN_ROLE_ARN_PROD`, `ALB_INGRESS_CIDRS_PROD` (repo, optional), `PROMOTION_TARGET_ACCOUNT_ID` (env `dev`).

### H. Secrets and variables (nothing below reaches Terraform state except account IDs inside ARNs and the sensitive CIDRs, as today)

| Name | Level | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `AWS_REGION` | repo variable (an environment variable of the same name would override it) | all |
| `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID_DEV`, `AWS_PLAN_ROLE_ARN_DEV`, `ALB_INGRESS_CIDRS_DEV` | repo secret | PR plan (dev), smoke test; `_DEV` account also for the `app-promote` source host |
| `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID_PROD`, `AWS_PLAN_ROLE_ARN_PROD`, `ALB_INGRESS_CIDRS_PROD` | repo secret | PR plan (prod), dev PR plan (promotion grant), N1, N10 |
| `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`, `AWS_APPLY_ROLE_ARN`, `AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN`, `ALB_INGRESS_CIDRS` | environment secret (`dev`, `prod`) | apply, destroy, deploy, promote |
| `PROMOTION_TARGET_ACCOUNT_ID` | environment secret (`dev` only) | dev apply (repo policy) |

Never in Terraform or git: the app secret values (set by the user with `put-secret-value`), the ECR auth tokens (crane config in `$RUNNER_TEMP`), and the prod root email.

### I. PR split

- **PR A: env cloning and workflow parametrization (dev only).**
  - P1 (generic `tests/envs.tftest.hcl` in `envs/dev/`), P2 script, P3 guard, P4 names, P5 secret names, P6 (dev legs), P8 policies (minus the `app-promote` exception), YAML-loader self-tests.
  - No bootstrap re-apply. The dev plan addresses are identical to Phase 6.
- **PR B: prod.**
  - `envs/prod/` (via `make new-env ENV=prod FROM=dev STRATEGY=BLUE_GREEN`), `accounts/prod.tfvars.example`.
  - Module BLUE_GREEN, bootstrap F, `app-promote.yml`, crane, waiter P14, guards P15, prod legs of every workflow, N10, N1 for prod.
  - Merged only after the prod bootstrap and secrets exist, so its own prod plan check is green.

## Alternatives considered

- **One shared root with `<env>.tfvars` per env (P1 s).** No copied `.tf` files, so drift is impossible by construction, and cloning is one new tfvars file. Rejected by the user: one lock file means a provider or Terraform bump reaches prod in the same merge as dev, and it departs from the PLAN layout. Per-env roots with the parity guard give the same drift protection and keep staged upgrades.
- **A single root with `var.env` selecting a committed locals map.** Cloning becomes an HCL edit by script, and it breaks "values only through tfvars". Rejected.
- **Environment-gated PR plans (`environment: dev-plan`)** to remove the repo-level secrets. This changes the plan role `sub` (ADR 0003), adds deployment records to every PR, and leaves branch-policy behavior for PR refs unverified. Rejected.
- **CodeDeploy blue/green.** A second deployment controller with AppSpec and its own roles. FR-15 asks for ECS built-in. Rejected.
- **`LINEAR` or `CANARY` now.** FR-15 says to document CANARY as the next step. Deferred.
- **A PAUSE hook at `POST_TEST_TRAFFIC_SHIFT` with a test header rule**, for a manual green check. Nice for a talk, but it needs `ContinueServiceDeployment` and adds a second approval surface. Deferred (Q11).
- **Region-deny SCP on prod.** Zero cost, but outside the PLAN scope, and a mistake locks the user out. Deferred (Q15).

## Consequences

### Risks

| R | Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| R18 | Terraform drift after a blue/green deploy (rule weights; possible `load_balancer` target group swap) | `ignore_changes` on the rule action. Step B15 checks a prod plan after a promote and adds `load_balancer` to `ignore_changes` if needed |
| R19 | The first prod service create uses the placeholder, which never serves. No `COMPLETED` deployment exists, so the **first** promote cannot roll back | Demo order: good promote first, broken revision second |
| R20 | The scoped infra policy misses an action ECS adds later | Fails closed. Fallback: attach the managed policy (bootstrap) |
| R21 | The dev apply role can write any policy on `sis-dev-*` repositories | Module code is reviewed, and a test pins the document. The role is approval-gated. Residual, accepted |
| R22 | Promotion needs the dev stack (and its ECR) up | Session order in B9 to B11. P19 alternative recorded |
| R23 | An alarm in `ALARM` at deployment start disables alarm rollback | P15 preflight |
| R24 | crane is a new binary | Version and checksum pinned. Provenance file available (optional verify). Fallback: AWS CLI layer copy |
| R25 | Prod PR plan: anyone with push access reads prod metadata via the plan role before review | Read-only, G1 denies secret values, state-only S3. Residual, accepted (extends ADR 0007 M1) |
| R26 | A copied root drifts from dev (a fix lands in one env only) | The parity guard fails the PR on any difference outside the four allowed files, and names the file |
| R27 | The parity guard checks lists, not semantics | Review. The script prints the exact edits |
| R28 | BLUE_GREEN runs two tasks for the bake time of each deploy | 5-minute bake, `desired_count = 1`, destroy after each session |
| R29 | Docs differ on which mechanism rolls back blue/green | B12 records which one fired (`statusReason`) |
| R30 | N1, N10 and the demos send prod alert emails | By design |
| R31 | `UpdateService` on a BLUE_GREEN service might require PassRole on the infra role | Fails closed. Add a PassRole statement with the condition if B11 shows it |

### Other consequences

- **Cost.** Prod costs about the same per hour as dev (ALB plus one Fargate task), plus a second task during each bake time. CloudTrail's first copy is free per account. Three standard alarms fit inside the 10-alarm free tier noted in ADR 0007 Finding 6. Organizations is free. ECR storage is tens of MB. Prices were not re-checked.
- **Docs (orchestrator, D14):**
  - PLAN layout and FR-6 wording (single root);
  - README (environments, cloning, promotion, blue/green, demos, secrets table);
  - CODING_STANDARDS (env names, secret naming, reusable workflow rule, crane);
  - PROGRESS (Phase 7, closed items: YAML loader, composite action dropped, N1 Low);
  - ADR 0002 (infra role, guardrail G4);
  - ADR 0005 and 0006 (waiter, destroy input);
  - ADR 0007 (policy exceptions);
  - diagrams (prod account, promotion path, blue/green).

## Checkpoint commands (the user runs these; Claude never does, NFR-9)

Placeholders: `<DEV_ACCOUNT_ID>`, `<PROD_ACCOUNT_ID>`, `<PR_A>`, `<PR_B>`, `<SHA>`, `<PROD_ALB>`, `<BROKEN_REV>`. Each command is one line for zsh; there are no packed arguments (lessons 5, 37). Dispatches use the web UI (Actions > workflow > Run workflow), because the PAT has Actions read-only (lesson 31).

### PR A

**A1. Environment secret for dev.** The command prompts for the value; paste `<DEV_ACCOUNT_ID>`.
```bash
gh secret set AWS_ACCOUNT_ID --env dev --repo trungleviet-agilityio/ship-it-safely
gh secret list --env dev --repo trungleviet-agilityio/ship-it-safely
```
Only if `ALB_INGRESS_CIDRS_DEV` is set at repo level, also set `ALB_INGRESS_CIDRS` in env `dev` to the same value.

**A2. Checks**
```bash
gh pr checks <PR_A> --repo trungleviet-agilityio/ship-it-safely --watch
```
Expect green: `guard (no AWS)` (parity guard, policies, self-tests), `checks (no AWS)`, `plan-dev / plan (read-only role)`, `plan-dev / plan role guardrails`, and the sticky comment `terraform-iac:plan:dev`.

**A3. Script, locally (no AWS)**
```bash
scripts/new-env.sh qa --from dev --dry-run
scripts/new-env.sh Dev
git status --short
```
Expect: the dry run lists `envs/qa/` with `vpc_cidr = "10.50.0.0/16"`; `Dev` is refused; no files appear.

**A4. Merge and re-prove the dev cycle on the new layout.** The merge starts the `terraform-iac` push apply, and also `app-deploy` because `lib.sh` changed. Approve **only** the apply first (lesson 43). Expect 27 to add, with the same addresses as Phase 6. Then set the secret value (one line, own terminal):
```bash
AWS_PROFILE=sis-dev-admin aws secretsmanager put-secret-value --region ap-southeast-1 --secret-id sis/dev/app-api-key --secret-string "$(openssl rand -hex 24)" --query Name --output text
AWS_PROFILE=sis-dev-admin aws s3 ls s3://sis-dev-tfstate-<DEV_ACCOUNT_ID>-ap-southeast-1-an/envs/dev/
```
Expect `terraform.tfstate` under the unchanged key. Then re-run and approve `app-deploy`; `/version` shows the `main` SHA. Then Run workflow `terraform-destroy`: env `dev`, type **destroy-dev**, approve. Expect 27 destroyed and no account ID in any log.

### PR B

**B0. Answer Q1 to Q4 first.**

**B1. Organizations and access** (management account console or CLI). Create the organization if needed, then create the prod account with a unique root email (for example a plus-address of your budget email). Then in IAM Identity Center, assign your user the `AdministratorAccess` permission set on the prod account.
```bash
aws configure sso --profile sis-prod-admin
aws sso login --profile sis-prod-admin
AWS_PROFILE=sis-prod-admin aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text
```
The last command must print `<PROD_ACCOUNT_ID>`.
```bash
AWS_PROFILE=sis-prod-admin aws cloudtrail describe-trails --region ap-southeast-1 --query 'trailList[].[Name,IsMultiRegionTrail,HomeRegion]' --output text
AWS_PROFILE=sis-prod-admin aws iam list-open-id-connect-providers
```
Expect both empty. If a trail is listed (for example an organization trail), set `create_trail = false` in `prod.tfvars`. If an OIDC provider exists, report it before B3.

**B2. Fill the prod inputs** (gitignored file).
```bash
git switch <PR_B branch> && git pull
cp infra/terraform/bootstrap/accounts/prod.tfvars.example infra/terraform/bootstrap/accounts/prod.tfvars
```
Edit it: `aws_account_id = "<PROD_ACCOUNT_ID>"`, `budget_email`, `github_owner_id`, `github_repo_id` (same as dev), `promotion_source_account_id = "<DEV_ACCOUNT_ID>"`.

**B3. Prod bootstrap: first apply on local state, then migrate** (a separate `TF_DATA_DIR` keeps dev's `.terraform/` untouched).
```bash
printf 'terraform {\n  backend "local" {\n    path = "prod.tfstate"\n  }\n}\n' > infra/terraform/bootstrap/backend_override.tf
AWS_PROFILE=sis-prod-admin TF_DATA_DIR=.terraform-prod terraform -chdir=infra/terraform/bootstrap init
AWS_PROFILE=sis-prod-admin TF_DATA_DIR=.terraform-prod terraform -chdir=infra/terraform/bootstrap plan -var-file=accounts/prod.tfvars -out=prod-bootstrap.tfplan
AWS_PROFILE=sis-prod-admin TF_DATA_DIR=.terraform-prod terraform -chdir=infra/terraform/bootstrap apply prod-bootstrap.tfplan
rm infra/terraform/bootstrap/backend_override.tf
AWS_PROFILE=sis-prod-admin TF_DATA_DIR=.terraform-prod terraform -chdir=infra/terraform/bootstrap init -migrate-state -backend-config="bucket=sis-prod-tfstate-<PROD_ACCOUNT_ID>-ap-southeast-1-an"
AWS_PROFILE=sis-prod-admin TF_DATA_DIR=.terraform-prod terraform -chdir=infra/terraform/bootstrap plan -var-file=accounts/prod.tfvars
rm -f infra/terraform/bootstrap/prod.tfstate infra/terraform/bootstrap/prod.tfstate.backup infra/terraform/bootstrap/prod-bootstrap.tfplan
```
The second plan must show "No changes". Then confirm the SNS subscription email for prod.

**B4. GitHub environment `prod` and secrets**
```bash

```
The last three `gh secret set` commands prompt: paste `<PROD_ACCOUNT_ID>` each time.

**B5. Dev bootstrap re-apply** (adds the infra role and the new statements).
```bash
AWS_PROFILE=sis-dev-admin terraform -chdir=infra/terraform/bootstrap init -backend-config="bucket=sis-dev-tfstate-<DEV_ACCOUNT_ID>-ap-southeast-1-an"
AWS_PROFILE=sis-dev-admin terraform -chdir=infra/terraform/bootstrap plan -var-file=accounts/dev.tfvars -out=bootstrap.tfplan
AWS_PROFILE=sis-dev-admin terraform -chdir=infra/terraform/bootstrap apply bootstrap.tfplan
rm infra/terraform/bootstrap/bootstrap.tfplan
```
Expect about 2 to add (`aws_iam_role.ecs_elb`, `aws_iam_role_policy.ecs_elb`), 3 to change (`aws_iam_role_policy.apply`, `aws_iam_role_policy.deploy`, `aws_iam_policy.guardrails`), and 0 to destroy. Dev trust is unchanged.

**B6. PR checks**
```bash
gh pr checks <PR_B> --repo trungleviet-agilityio/ship-it-safely --watch
```
Expect `plan-dev` (`aws_ecr_repository_policy` planned, value shown as sensitive) and `plan-prod` (full create, about 32 resources). Two sticky comments. The guard is green.

**B7. Merge, then bring dev up.** Approve the push apply (about 28 to add, including the repo policy). Then:
```bash
AWS_PROFILE=sis-dev-admin aws secretsmanager put-secret-value --region ap-southeast-1 --secret-id sis/dev/app-api-key --secret-string "$(openssl rand -hex 24)" --query Name --output text
```
Then approve `app-deploy`; it must end green (this proves the waiter on ROLLING).

**B8. Prod up.** Run workflow `terraform-iac` with env `prod`, approve (about 32 to add). Then:
```bash
AWS_PROFILE=sis-prod-admin aws secretsmanager put-secret-value --region ap-southeast-1 --secret-id sis/prod/app-api-key --secret-string "$(openssl rand -hex 24)" --query Name --output text
```

**B9. Promote.** Run workflow `app-promote`: env `prod`, mode `promote`, sha `<SHA>` (the `main` commit that app-deploy just deployed). Approve `prod`. Expect `resolve` green, the lifecycle stages through `BAKE_TIME` and `CLEAN_UP`, and `SUCCESSFUL`. Then:
```bash
AWS_PROFILE=sis-dev-admin aws ecr describe-images --region ap-southeast-1 --repository-name sis-dev-app --image-ids imageTag=<SHA> --query 'imageDetails[0].imageDigest' --output text
AWS_PROFILE=sis-prod-admin aws ecr describe-images --region ap-southeast-1 --repository-name sis-prod-app --image-ids imageTag=<SHA> --query 'imageDetails[0].imageDigest' --output text
curl -s http://<PROD_ALB>/version
```
The two digests must be identical, and `/version` shows `prod`, `<SHA>` and that digest.

**B10. Broken release demo** (FR-15). In a second terminal, run `while true; do curl -s http://<PROD_ALB>/version; echo; sleep 5; done`. Then:
```bash
AWS_PROFILE=sis-prod-admin aws ecs describe-task-definition --region ap-southeast-1 --task-definition sis-prod-app --query taskDefinition --output json > td.json
jq '{family, taskRoleArn, executionRoleArn, networkMode, requiresCompatibilities, cpu, memory, runtimePlatform, volumes, containerDefinitions: (.containerDefinitions | map(.environment += [{"name":"BREAK","value":"true"}]))}' td.json > td-broken.json
AWS_PROFILE=sis-prod-admin aws ecs register-task-definition --region ap-southeast-1 --cli-input-json file://td-broken.json --query taskDefinition.revision --output text
AWS_PROFILE=sis-prod-admin aws ecs update-service --region ap-southeast-1 --cluster sis-prod-cluster --service sis-prod-app --task-definition sis-prod-app:<BROKEN_REV> --query service.serviceName --output text
AWS_PROFILE=sis-prod-admin aws ecs list-service-deployments --region ap-southeast-1 --cluster sis-prod-cluster --service sis-prod-app --query 'serviceDeployments[0].[status,statusReason]' --output text
```
Repeat the last command until `ROLLBACK_SUCCESSFUL`, and record whether `statusReason` names the alarm or the circuit breaker (R29). The curl loop must keep showing the good SHA. Then, **mandatory**:
```bash
AWS_PROFILE=sis-prod-admin aws ecs deregister-task-definition --region ap-southeast-1 --task-definition sis-prod-app:<BROKEN_REV> --query taskDefinition.status --output text
rm td.json td-broken.json
```
Optional bake-time demo: start another promote of the same `<SHA>`; when the log shows `BAKE_TIME`, run:
```bash
AWS_PROFILE=sis-prod-admin aws cloudwatch set-alarm-state --region ap-southeast-1 --alarm-name sis-prod-alb-5xx --state-value ALARM --state-reason "bake time rollback demo"
```
Expect the run to end red with a rollback, and traffic to stay on the previous revision.

**B11. N10.** Run workflow `app-promote`: env `prod`, mode `prove-isolation`, any `<SHA>`. Approve **dev**. Expect `sub` = `...:environment:dev`, `job_workflow_ref` = `.../app-promote.yml@refs/heads/main`, and three "denied as designed" lines (plan, apply, deploy). An alert email arrives from the prod account.

**B12. N1 for prod.** Run workflow `oidc-smoke-test` (dispatch). Expect refusals from both accounts.

**B13. Drift check (R18).** Open a PR that touches only `infra/terraform/envs/README.md`. The `plan-prod` comment must say no changes. Report any change on `aws_ecs_service.app` or `aws_lb_listener_rule.production`.

**B14. Teardown.** Run workflow `terraform-destroy` with env `prod`, type **destroy-prod**, approve (about 32 destroyed, revisions deregistered). Then the same for `dev` with **destroy-dev** (about 28). Bootstraps stay (close to zero cost).

## Open questions (recommendation first)

| Q | Recommendation | Alternatives |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Tell us where dev's Identity Center lives. If dev is standalone with an account instance, create a **new management account** (no workloads), create prod in it, and optionally invite dev | Dev already a member: just create prod. Dev is the management account: accept it for the lab (deviates from PLAN 7.1) |
| Q2 | Prod region `ap-southeast-1` (same as dev; one STS host, one alert region, no env-level `AWS_REGION`) | Another region: an env-level `AWS_REGION` in `prod`, a regional alert in that region, and PR plan inputs |
| Q3 | Prod `vpc_cidr = 10.50.0.0/16` (script default) | Any free `/16` in `10.0.0.0/8` |
| Q4 | Release trigger: `workflow_dispatch` with `sha`, gated on a green app-deploy (P10) | Tag `v*` (trust `StringLike ref`, tag ruleset) |
| Q5 | `prod` reviewer: yourself, prevent self-review off, `main` only, no wait timer | Wait timer of a few minutes |
| Q6 | Bake time 5 minutes | 10 minutes (more safety, more cost) |
| Q7 | PR plans for prod: yes (P18) | Plan only in the approved apply |
| Q8 | Infra role: scoped inline policy (P12) | AWS managed policy |
| Q9 | Uniform bootstrap grants (P13) | Prod-only grants |
| Q10 | One waiter on the service deployments API for dev and prod (P14) | Keep `describe-services` for dev |
| Q11 | No test listener rule or PAUSE hook now | Header test rule plus a PAUSE hook for a manual green check |
| Q12 | Broken-release demo through admin CLI (P16) | A pipeline-built broken image (needs a promote input that accepts non-main images) |
| Q13 | Prod root email: a plus-address of your budget email | A separate mailbox |
| Q14 | Keep ECR in the env stack (P19) | Move ECR to bootstrap so promotion works with dev torn down |
| Q15 | No SCPs in Phase 7 | Region-deny and deny-leave-org SCPs on the prod OU |

## Build briefs

### devops-engineer, PR A (owns `infra/**`, `.github/**`, `scripts/**`, `Makefile`, `.gitignore`)

Create a branch from the phase branch (lesson 25). Read this ADR at its absolute path in `docs/adr/`.

**Files**

- `envs/dev/`: `tests/dev.tftest.hcl` becomes the generic `tests/envs.tftest.hcl` (names from `var.env`); the
  README names the env only through `terraform.tfvars` so it can stay identical (D16). Location, backend key and
  tfvars stay as they are.
- `envs` and module `variables.tf`: env regex (P4).
- `bootstrap/variables.tf`: env regex, no other change.
- `scripts/`:
  - `lib.sh`: `valid_env` rule;
  - `new-env.sh` (new);
  - `workflow_envs.py` and `check-env-parity.sh` (new);
  - `harden_runner_policy.py`, `workflow_triggers.py` (P8);
  - `selftest/new-env.sh` (new);
  - `selftest/workflows.sh` (YAML loader instead of `sed` ranges);
- `Makefile`: `new-env` target.
- `.gitignore`: `.terraform-*/`.
- Workflows per D (PR A column), and `reusable-terraform-plan.yml`.

**Tests first**

- T1 to T14 and the parity fixtures.
- Policy fixtures: a `uses:` job, `secrets: inherit`, `secrets[` in an audit job, `env` from a secret in an audit job, `workflow_call` outside `reusable-*`, a reusable file with a second trigger.
- `envs.tftest.hcl` passes in `envs/dev/` and in a `make new-env ENV=qa` copy made in a temp clone.
- Parity fixtures: a changed `main.tf` in a copy fails; a changed `versions.tf` or lock file passes; a wrong `key` or `env` fails.

**Done**

- `make check` green on a fresh clone; actionlint and zizmor clean.
- `terraform test` for envs, module and bootstrap passes offline.
- No 12-digit literal anywhere.
- `scripts/new-env.sh qa --dry-run` output pasted in the hand-back.
- No `apply` or `destroy` target. The script never invokes `terraform`, `aws` or `gh` (T10).

### devops-engineer, PR B

**Files**

- `make new-env ENV=prod FROM=dev STRATEGY=BLUE_GREEN`, then review `envs/prod/terraform.tfvars` (`bake_time_minutes = 5`). Add `deployment_strategy = "ROLLING"` and `promotion_target_env = "prod"` to `envs/dev/terraform.tfvars`.
- `bootstrap/accounts/prod.tfvars.example`.
- Module E: `alb.tf`, `ecs.tf`, `alarms.tf` (new), `ecr.tf`, variables, tests, README.
- Root variables and `main.tf` wiring.
- Bootstrap F: `iam_ecs_elb.tf` (new), `iam_apply.tf`, `iam_deploy.tf`, `iam_guardrails.tf`, `locals.tf`, `variables.tf`, `outputs.tf`, tests, README.
- `scripts/`:
  - `ecs-wait-deployment.sh` (P14, evaluator fixtures for SUCCESSFUL, IN_PROGRESS with a stage, ROLLBACK_SUCCESSFUL, ROLLBACK_FAILED, STOPPED, no matching revision);
  - `ecs-preflight.sh` (alarm guard);
  - `render-task-def.sh` (environment rule);
  - `ecr-promote.sh` (new: resolve, copy, verify, never prints an account);
  - `install-ci-tools.sh`, `ci-tools.sha256` and `mise.toml` (crane v0.22.1; check the two digests in Finding 7 against `checksums.txt`);
  - policy exception for `app-promote.yml`.
- Workflows per D (PR B column), `app-promote.yml`, `oidc-smoke-test.yml` N1.

**Tests first**

- Module: the ROLLING and BLUE_GREEN asserts, the repo policy document, the validation.
- Bootstrap: deploy `job_workflow_ref` by source variable; PassRole only on the infra role with the condition; no action wildcard in Allow statements; source pull only on the one ARN; infra role trust and scoped resources.
- Waiter, preflight, render and `ecr-promote.sh` fixtures (stubbed `aws` and `crane`: tag exists with an equal digest, an unequal digest fails, copy then verify).
- Parity guard: `app-promote` options equal envs minus dev.

**Done**

- `make check` green.
- `plan-dev` and `plan-prod` green on the PR after B5.
- The hand-back lists the expected plan counts and every new allowlist host with its source line.

### backend-dev

No change: Phase 7 touches no `app/**` file. The demo uses the existing `BREAK` variable, and promotion ships the same image.

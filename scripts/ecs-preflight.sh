# Before a deploy, fail early and clearly (ADR 0005, F16, Q2; ADR 0006, G14). Needs the AWS CLI with deploy credentials.
# 1. The ECS service must be ACTIVE: a green run must always mean "deployed", so a missing stack fails.
# 2. The app secret must have a current value (an AWSCURRENT version). A secret that was just re-created has none,
#    and the rollout would end in a circuit-breaker rollback. DescribeSecret returns metadata only; version IDs are
#    never printed.
# 3. N4: the deploy role must be denied the secret value (explicit deny, FR-3). The call asks for the secret name
#    only, so even a broken deny could not return the value. Because it is an explicit deny, the answer is
#    AccessDeniedException whether or not the secret exists; anything else is a failure.
# Names derive from ENV (default dev). Error text is printed with 12-digit runs replaced.

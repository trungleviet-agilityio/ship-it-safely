# Build the app image the way CI and the deploy do (ADR 0005, F6; ADR 0007 S21). One platform and no attestations
# keep a single image digest everywhere. The unit tests run inside the build (the runtime stage copies from the test
# stage).
#
# The Dockerfile has one literal `FROM <image>:<tag>@sha256:<digest> AS base` (so Dependabot can bump it), and the
# other stages build FROM base. Any mirror that serves that digest yields the same bits. Anonymous pulls are limited
# per IP (ECR Public also by data volume), and hosted runners share IPs, so on a registry refusal the build moves to
# the next mirror through a named build context: `--build-context base=docker-image://<mirror>:<tag>@sha256:<digest>`
# replaces the stage called base. After a full round it waits and tries again. Any other failure (a test, the
# Dockerfile) is final on the first attempt.
#

#                              registry path such as docker.io/library/python (default: `dockerfile`, then Docker Hub)
#        BUILD_RETRY_DELAYS    seconds to wait before each further round (default "30 60"; the self-test sets "0")
#        APP_DIR               build context holding the Dockerfile (default: app/; the self-test uses a fixture)

# Deregister every ACTIVE task definition revision of the app family after the stack is destroyed (ADR 0006, G12;
# closes ADR 0005, F23). Terraform deregisters only the revisions it created, so the ones app-deploy registered
# would stay ACTIVE. INACTIVE revisions cost nothing. Needs the AWS CLI with apply credentials (no new permission:
# DescribeTaskDefinition and DeregisterTaskDefinition are already allowed).
# 1. It runs only when the service is gone (MISSING or INACTIVE), so it never pulls a revision from a live service.
# 2. DescribeTaskDefinition with a family returns the latest ACTIVE revision, and ClientException means none is
#    left. Each revision is deregistered once. If the same revision comes back right after it was deregistered
#    (eventual consistency), the describe is retried once after DEREGISTER_RETRY_SLEEP seconds (default 5); a second
#    repeat fails.
# MAX_REVISIONS (default 200) caps the loop. Prints DEREGISTERED=<count> on stdout, also when the script fails
# (an EXIT trap), so the job summary shows how far it got. Names derive from ENV.

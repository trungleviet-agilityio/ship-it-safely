"""Trigger allowlist for GitHub workflow files (ADR 0007 S34, ADR 0004 L1 and L-a).

The apply and deploy roles cannot tell `push` from `pull_request_target`, `issue_comment` or
`workflow_run` on main, so the repository refuses every trigger outside ALLOWED. This parses real
YAML (PyYAML, from the hash-locked CI venv), so flow lists split across lines, explicit `?` keys,
quoted keys and anchors cannot hide a trigger the way they could from a line scanner.

Usage: python -I scripts/guard/workflow_triggers.py <workflow file>...
A reusable workflow (`workflow_call`) is allowed only in a file named reusable-*.yml, and such a
file carries no other trigger (ADR 0008, P8).
Prints one violation per line on stdout, with paths relative to the working directory.
Exit codes: 0 all files pass, 1 violations, 2 usage error.
Run through scripts/guard/workflow-triggers.sh, which picks the interpreter and lists the files.

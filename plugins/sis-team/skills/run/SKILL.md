# /sis-team:run

Phase: `$ARGUMENTS` (ask for it if empty).

## 0. Preconditions

- The working tree is clean and on `main` (or a feature branch cut from it). Build agents branch their
  worktrees from the default branch, so anything uncommitted is invisible to them: if `git status` is not
  clean, stop and ask the user to commit first.
- `docs/adr/` has an `accepted` ADR for this phase. If not, tell the user to run `/sis-team:plan <phase>`
  (Phase 0 may skip this: it follows `PLAN.md` §6 directly).
- Create a feature branch `phase-<n>-<slug>` for the merged result.

## 1. Build (parallel)

Decide which build agents the phase needs from the paths it touches:

| Paths | Agent |
|---|---|
| `app/**` | `sis-team:backend-dev` |
| `infra/**`, `.github/**`, `.tflint.hcl`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `Makefile`, `scripts/**` | `sis-team:devops-engineer` |

Spawn the needed agents in one message so they run in parallel. Give each: the phase, its requirement IDs,
its build brief from the ADR, and the path ownership above. Each works in its own worktree.

## 2. Merge

Merge each agent's worktree branch into the feature branch. Ownership is disjoint, so conflicts mean an agent
left its lane: stop and show the user. Remove the worktrees afterwards.

## 3. Docs (you, not an agent)

You own `README.md` and `docs/**` (ADR 0001 D14); build agents never edit them. After the merge, update the
docs this phase changed, from the ADR and the merged diff:

- `README.md`: setup steps, commands, variables, ports and outputs that the phase added or changed, plus any
  section `PLAN.md` asks for in this phase (for example the trust conditions, cost and teardown notes).
- `docs/**` other than `docs/adr/`: runbooks or notes the phase calls for.
- Write only what the code does now. Every command must match a real script, target or workflow; no account
  IDs or emails (D2).

Commit the docs separately (`docs(<scope>): ...`) so verify sees them in the diff.

## 4. Verify (parallel)

Spawn in one message: `sis-team:e2e`, `sis-team:reviewer`, `sis-team:security-reviewer`,
`sis-team:code-simplifier`. Give each the phase, requirement IDs and the list of changed files
(`git diff --name-only main...HEAD`).

## 5. Fix loop (at most 2 rounds)

- Critical/High security findings, reviewer bugs and new e2e failures go back to the owning build agent as a
  focused brief, then re-run only the verify agents that reported them. Docs drift findings you fix yourself.
- Medium/Low findings and simplifier suggestions are listed for the user, not auto-fixed.
- After 2 rounds, stop and report what is still open.

## 6. Checkpoint (always stop here)

Commit on the feature branch (Conventional Commit, per phase). Then report:

1. What was built (files, one line each).
2. A verify table: agent, result, open findings.
3. The exact commands the user runs by hand for this phase's checkpoint in `PLAN.md`, such as
   `terraform apply`, `aws secretsmanager put-secret-value`, GitHub environment setup, `git push` and PR.
   Never run them yourself.

Do not push or open a PR unless the user asks.

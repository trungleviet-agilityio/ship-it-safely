You build the demo app "Ship-it Board" for the ship-it-safely lab. You own `app/**` only. Do not touch
`infra/**` or `.github/**`; if a change there is needed, say so in your report.

## Constraints (from PLAN.md §6 and ADR 0001)

- Python 3.13, standard library only. One source file of about 100 lines plus tests. No database, no frontend
  framework.
- Endpoints: `GET /`, `GET /health` (500 when `BREAK=true`), `GET /version`, `GET /admin` (401 unless
  `X-API-Key` equals `APP_API_KEY`). Compare keys with `hmac.compare_digest`.
- Never print or log the value of `APP_API_KEY`. `secret_loaded: yes/no` is the only thing the page reveals.
- Dockerfile: multi-stage, pinned base image by digest, non-root user, `GIT_SHA` build arg, `HEALTHCHECK` on
  `/health` using Python (no curl in the image).
- `docker-compose.yml` reads `.env`; commit `.env.example` with fake values only.

## Method: TDD

1. Write failing tests first with `unittest` (stdlib) for each endpoint and the `BREAK` and API key cases.
2. Implement until `python3 -m unittest discover -s app/tests` passes.
3. Build the image: `docker build --build-arg GIT_SHA=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) -t sis-app:local app`.
4. Run `hadolint app/Dockerfile` if installed.
5. Commit in your worktree with a Conventional Commit message.

## Report

Return: files changed, test output summary, image build result, the worktree branch name, and anything left
for `devops-engineer`. Never claim a check passed that you did not run.
